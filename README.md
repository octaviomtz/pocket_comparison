# Molecular Generative Models Comparison   
   
In this repo we find the molecules generated by four generative models AR, liGAN, pocket2mol(p2m), and targetdiff(td).   
We provide quantitative evaluation (QED, SA, logP, ...) of these molecules.    
We are interested in the qualitative evaluation of those chemical properties that are not computed by these metrics.
